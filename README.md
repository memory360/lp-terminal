# LP TERMINAL

Multi-chain terminal-style frontend for LPs. Robinhood Chain includes UP33
(ve(3,3) DEX) plus official **Uniswap v2 + v3**; BNB Smart Chain includes the
official Uniswap deployments. POSITIONS shows
and manages UP33 + univ3, POOLS browses/adds liquidity across all three,
distinguished by protocol badges (brand mark + colored label). Discovery runs on
a self-hosted **pool indexer** (see below) with a client-side fallback.
Terminal *style* — full-bleed layout, not a boxed console.
Chain-specific addresses and API behavior live under `src/chains/robinhood/`
and `src/chains/bsc/`; shared code only consumes the chain adapter.

**Status**: v1, built for personal use and opened up as-is. See
[Known v1 limits](#known-v1-limits). MIT licensed — see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)
before you point it at real money.

## Run

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # every key is optional; defaults hit public endpoints
npm run smoke          # optional: live-chain read-layer validation (TickMath, ABIs, quotes)
npm run indexer:manager # starts the selected chain indexer on demand
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api -> manager :8790)
```

Environment comes from the **repo-root `.env`** (via vite `envDir`) — see
`.env.example` for the annotated template:

| key | use |
|---|---|
| `RPC` / `RPC_ROBINHOOD` | private Robinhood Chain RPC (**secret** — personal/local builds only) |
| `RPC_BSC` | optional private BSC indexer RPC; otherwise the public BSC RPC is used |
| `BSCSCAN_API_KEY` | server-side BscScan key used by the BSC V3 event backfill |
| `THEGRAPH_API_KEY` | server-side Graph gateway key for BSC Uniswap V2 statistics |
| `KYBERSWAP_AGGREGATOR_API_BASE_URL` | kyber aggregator base |
| `KYBERSWAP_CHAIN` | chain slug (`robinhood`) |
| `KYBERSWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS` | **whitelist** — swap calldata is only ever sent to this address |
| `KYBERSWAP_FEE_BPS` | optional platform fee in bps on kyber swaps (e.g. `10` = 0.1%); off when unset |
| `KYBERSWAP_FEE_RECEIVER` | optional; address that receives the fee (both must be set to activate) |
| `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` | optional; only needed for WalletConnect QR pairing (injected wallets work without it) |

KyberSwap platform fees are **verified working on this chain**: the fee rides the
routes request (`feeAmount`/`chargeFeeBy=currency_out`/`isInBps`/`feeReceiver`),
is echoed in `routeSummary.extraFee`, deducted from the quoted output, and encoded
into the swap calldata by `route/build` — the router pays the receiver on-chain.
Price displays (UP price in the add-LP sims) always quote fee-free.

Signing is browser-wallet only (RainbowKit / injected EIP-6963). No private keys anywhere.

**i18n (en/zh)**: react-i18next with typed keys — catalogs in `src/i18n/en.ts` (source of
truth) + `zh.ts` (`typeof en` enforces identical key structure at compile time). Language:
footer `lang:` switcher, persisted (`up33.lang.v1`), `?lang=` view-only override
(screenshots), `<html lang>` + RainbowKit modal locale follow. Non-React modules
(tx step labels, zap planner) import the singleton `t` from `src/i18n`; revert hints
resolve lazily so they follow the active language at error time. Number/date formats
stay en-US in both locales (terminal convention; zh uses the same digit grouping).
The `#lab` dev page stays English.

## Tabs

Keyboard: `1–3` switch tabs, `4` opens LIMIT, `/` focuses the pool filter. Tabs
are hash-routed (`#pools`, `#swap`, …) so reloads and deep links keep your
place. `#lab` renders the component lab (synthetic data) for visual tweaking.

- **[1] POOLS** — one table, three protocols, sorted by TVL by default. UP33 v2 + CL pools come from live factory enumeration; **Uniswap v2 + v3 pools** come from the pool indexer (`/api` — the FULL catalog built from factory events — six figures and growing ~20k pools/day, launchpads mint univ3 pools continuously — chain-derived TVL, GeckoTerminal 24h stats). Columns: fee rate, reserves/price (auto-oriented quote/base), **TVL / VOL 24H / FEES 24H** (UP33: DexScreener + Goldsky v2 subgraph; uniswap: indexer), **FEE APR / EMIT APR**, UP/wk emissions, vote share; all numeric headers sortable; `● MY POOLS` filter marks pools you're in. The `UNISWAP ⌕` row searches the whole catalog — token address / pool address / symbol / `sym0/sym1` pair, empty = everything by TVL — with a `HIDE <$1K` dust chip (on by default: 95% of the catalog is dust meme pools); if the indexer is down it falls back to DexScreener discovery with on-chain `factory.getPool` verification (v3 top 30, amber notice). Inline add-liquidity everywhere: v2 auto-ratio (UP33 Solidly router or vanilla Router02, per pool); CL/univ3 with the full range picker — symmetric presets (±0.5/1/2/5/10/20/30%, FULL), custom ±%, **one-sided ↑ABOVE / ↓BELOW** (single-token deposits that start earning when price enters — sell-the-rise / buy-the-dip), **price-bounds input** (snapped to tick spacing), raw ticks — with a live range-bar preview; amounts rebalance automatically when the range changes. univ3 mints go through the official NPM (fee-keyed mint struct, no levy, no gauge — fee APR only).

  **⚡ ZAP — one-token add (all four pool kinds + increase)**: every add panel has a `FUND: PAIR | ⚡ ZAP` switch. ZAP funds the position with ONE token (either side, or native ETH when a side is WETH — wrapped as step 1): it solves how much to swap so the two piles match the deposit ratio the target needs (CL band math / v2 reserves; seeded at spot, refined over ≤2 kyber quotes since the execution rate moves the answer), previews the plan (`SPLIT / SWAP` with min-out + impact + route, `DEPOSIT` with est. dust, `PROJECTED` APRs), lists the exact tx sequence (numbered, live states), then runs it step by step: wrap? → approve → gated kyber swap → approve both sides → mint / increase / addLiquidity. The deposit uses the amounts that **actually arrived** (receipt Transfer logs), never the quote; any failure **halts** — every intermediate asset is a normal wallet balance, nothing strands. `REWARDS` column shows its full emissions sub-line only under the `UP33` filter (elsewhere it's a slim `—`/APR column).

  APR semantics (ve(3,3): a position earns one or the other, never both):
  - `FEE APR` — **unstaked** LP net fee yield: `vol24h × feeRate × 365 / TVL`, CL further × (1 − unstaked levy). Staked LPs earn **zero** fees (theirs go to the pool's voters). CL number is the pool average — a concentrated in-range position earns proportionally more.
  - `EMIT APR` — **staked** LP UP yield: `rewardRate × 31.536M × UP price / staked TVL`, where staked TVL is v2 `gauge.totalSupply/pool.totalSupply × TVL`, CL `stakedLiquidity/liquidity × TVL` (active-liquidity proxy; out-of-range staked earns nothing). `rewardRate` is the live post-cap stream, so gauge-cap burns are already reflected; it is only committed until the Thursday flip (`periodFinish`), and later cap releases within an epoch can raise it (values refresh live). `∞` = emissions streaming to ~zero staked TVL (first staker takes it all).
  - Simple APR, no compounding; both dilute as TVL/staked TVL grows.
  - **Add-LP simulation**: both add panels show a `PROJECTED` line for *your* prospective position — deposit USD (priced via USDG/WETH/UP anchors), your share of active liquidity, and your fee/emit APR. For CL this is position-specific: `share = L_yours / (activeLiquidity + L_yours)` (fees) and `/ (stakedLiquidity + L_yours)` (emissions), so range concentration and self-dilution are captured exactly — e.g. a ±2% range earns several× the pool-average APR while in range. Out-of-range ranges warn that they earn nothing.
- **[2] POSITIONS** — summary strip (**LP VALUE** in USD across everything incl. uncollected fees, **PENDING UP** with USD value + live `+UP/day` accrual + **CLAIM ALL**, range status, open range-order count with filled alert), then every held LP sorted staked-first / biggest-first. Every card answers the two questions an LP manages by — **worth** (`value ≈ $…`, tokens priced off the pool's own price against USDG/WETH/UP anchors; fees/pending shown in USD too) and **earning right now** (`earning` line: staked → `UP/day + $/day + APR + share of staked liq`; unstaked/univ3 in range → `fee APR + $/day + share of active liq` from 24h stats — indexer stats fetched per held uniswap pool; out of range → red zero; emissions dry → amber). **Multi-protocol**: UP33 CL/v2 positions plus wallet positions from the official Uniswap v3 NPM (`0x7399…E0D3`, pairing chain-verified — Blockscout also lists several unofficial forks). Each card carries a protocol badge (UP arrow / Uniswap unicorn, brand-colored). Uniswap pools are discovered per position via `factory.getPool`, unknown pair tokens get erc20 metadata fetched live, fees use the same `collect`-simulation, and increase/decrease/collect/withdraw all work (write entrypoints are signature-identical; only the NPM address differs). No staking on univ3 (no gauges), and SWAP→LIMIT tags never attach to univ3 ids (tokenIds are only unique per NPM):
  - CL: **range bar** (ends = your price bounds, marker = current price, % drift to each bound, re-entry distance when out of range, in/near/out coloring), holdings, uncollected fees (exact, via `collect` simulation) or pending UP when staked. Actions: stake/unstake, claim UP, collect fees, increase, decrease (decrease+collect), withdraw (double-click confirm). The increase panel shows wallet balances + MAX, auto-links the two amounts at the live pool price, and previews the exact pull/new size — the range itself is immutable (`increaseLiquidity` has no tick params; it stacks liquidity on the band fixed at mint). Range orders placed via SWAP→LIMIT carry a `LIMIT sell→buy` badge, an order-mode range bar (waiting/filling x%/filled instead of the red out-of-range alarm, priced in the sell token), and a state-aware one-click action: `CANCEL — GET <sell> BACK` (unfilled) / `CLOSE NOW` (partial) / `WITHDRAW → LOCK IN <buy>` (filled); the tag clears on 100% withdraw.
  - after any claim (or CL unstake, which auto-claims) confirms, the log shows the exact UP received with a **SWAP → ETH** button — it jumps to SWAP prefilled with the claimed amount.
  - v2: wallet vs staked LP, underlying amounts, claimable pool fees, pending UP. Actions: stake all / unstake all / claim UP / claim fees / remove %.
- **[3] SWAP** — two modes:
  - **MARKET** — KyberSwap aggregator quote vs **UP33-native best** (v2 `getAmountsOut` + CL quoter across all matching pools), side-by-side with bps diff; executes whichever you select. ETH⇄WETH wrap/unwrap built in.
  - **LIMIT · SELL VIA LP** (`#limit`, key `4`) — sell a token with a **one-sided CL range order**. The point is **maker-not-taker economics**: a market swap through the pool pays its fee (1% on WETH/UP); a range order pays none and *earns* fees while filling (the panel shows the comparison and an est. $/day while in-band). Pick sell/buy tokens (auto-picks the deepest CL pool; chips if several fee tiers), 25/50/75/MAX amount chips with USD estimate, choose a band: **TIGHT · 1 TICK** (default — one tick-spacing hugging market, fills on the first uptick) or +1→3% … +10→25% / custom, snapped to tick spacing; a `?` chip opens a structured band explainer (start/end/avg/grid rows). The panel renders as a structured **order ticket** (aligned key-value sections, no prose walls) phrased in the sell token's price: `ORDER` (fill-start / fully-sold / avg-fill premiums with exact prices — avg is the band's geometric mean, exact closed form — band ticks with a `≡ TIGHT` marker when a small custom band snaps onto the tight one, order-mode range bar), `PROJECTED · FULL FILL` (avg price vs market, exact proceeds + USD, est. fee income $/day while in band), `FEES · MAKER VS TAKER` (0% vs pool fee ≈ $ on your size), `MECHANICS` (fills / un-fills / after-fill withdraw / don't stake). Placing mints an out-of-range one-sided position (sell-side min ≈ 100% guards against the price having entered the band). Fills as the token appreciates through the band and earns pool fees while filling; **un-fills if price retreats** and nothing auto-executes — withdraw after fill to lock in.

## Safety rails

- Kyber calldata is opaque → four gates before sending: the API's `routerAddress` must equal the `.env` whitelist (and the tx `to` is always the whitelist address, never the API's), `transactionValue` must match expectation exactly (0 for ERC-20 in, amountIn for native ETH), the built `amountIn` must equal the request, and the built `amountOut` must be ≥ the fresh quote minus the user's slippage (catches degraded/tampered builds). The gates live in ONE place (`lib/kyberExec.ts`) shared by SWAP and ZAP so they can never diverge.
- ZAP adds two more on its swap leg: the fresh route's `tokenOut` must be the pool's counter-token, and the fresh output must still be within slippage (+0.5% grace) of the previewed plan — otherwise it halts before the wallet ever sees the tx. Deposits then use the received-amount ground truth from the receipt, and approvals stay exact-amount per step.
- Exact-amount approvals only (no infinite approvals).
- All writes pinned to chainId 4663; wrong-network banner blocks confusion.
- Everything reads live on-chain state each ~15s (protocol parameters are Safe-controlled and can change at any time). Pools hosting your range orders get a dedicated **4s slot0 feed** (single multicall) so fill %, holdings and the range bar track near-live; numeric updates flash **green ▲ / red ▼** by direction, and the range-bar marker glides so drift direction is visible.

## Pool indexer (`indexer/`)

The heavier backend behind uniswap discovery. Zero npm dependencies beyond the
app's own (`viem`, `tsx`; storage is node's built-in `node:sqlite`, requires
node ≥ 22.13). One process, four loops, a read-only HTTP API:

- **Catalog** — the authoritative pool list, built ONLY from the official
  factories: univ3 `PoolCreated` logs (backfill via Blockscout's uncapped
  etherscan-style `getLogs`, ~22 pages for full history, with automatic
  fallback to windowed RPC `getLogs` if Blockscout flakes; then a 10s RPC
  tail), univ2 `allPairsLength`/`allPairs` enumeration (backfill == tail).
  Third-party APIs never admit a pool — they only enrich — so spoofed/fork
  pools are structurally excluded (stronger than the old per-query
  `factory.getPool` round-trip, which remains as the client-side fallback).
- **State sweeps** (multicall, 400 calls/aggregate) — univ3: `slot0` +
  `liquidity` + both erc20 balances; univ2: `getReserves` + `totalSupply`.
  Hot pools (TVL ≥ $10k, GT-listed, or < 1h old) refresh every 60s; the whole
  catalog hourly (~280 aggregates); new pools immediately.
- **Pricing waterfall → TVL** — GeckoTerminal token prices seed (ground truth
  while < 30 min old), then prices propagate through the deepest priced-side
  pool (≥ $300 depth so dust can't set prices), USDG ≈ $1 bootstraps before
  the first GT cycle. TVL = sum of priced sides (one side priced → 2×, flagged
  approximate). All REAL numbers are display/ranking only — never tx inputs.
- **Stats** — GeckoTerminal top lists (network + uniswap-v2 + uniswap-v3, top
  200 each, paced ≤ 30 calls/min free tier) every 5 min: 24h volume/txns +
  GT's own reserve figure. GT has no UP33 entry — UP33 stats stay on the
  frontend's dexscreener/goldsky path.
- **API** — `GET /api/pools?q=&proto=univ2,univ3&min_tvl=&sort=tvl|vol|created&limit=&offset=`
  (response shape mirrors the frontend's `PoolsData`/`PoolStat`; bigints as
  strings; `ready:false` while the first backfill runs → frontend keeps its
  fallback), `GET /api/tokens?q=` (symbol/address autocomplete),
  `GET /api/health` (counts, cursors, rss).

Data lives in `indexer/data/index.db` (WAL SQLite); delete it to re-backfill
from scratch — the kv cursors make every loop resumable.

The tuning above follows from the chain's scale, measured July 2026: ~100k+
univ3 pools **growing ~20k/day** (launchpad factories mint a pool per token),
11,640 univ2 pairs, ≥95% dust, 100ms blocks (~862k/day), and ~2.6M Swap
events/day chain-wide — which is why volume comes from GeckoTerminal instead
of self-indexed swaps (revisit with Envio HyperIndex, which supports chain 4663
natively, if self-computed fee/APR analytics are ever wanted). At this scale a
full state sweep is ~1k multicall aggregates (~7 min hourly); the hot tier stays
tiny because real TVL, not pool count, bounds it. If you re-measure the pool
count, use the RPC-window scan — Blockscout's paged `getLogs` silently
undercounts.

## Chain reads

The app is a **fully static SPA — it has no backend of its own**. The browser talks
directly to: the chain RPC (reads only; writes are signed and sent by the user's
wallet), the KyberSwap aggregator, DexScreener, and the Goldsky subgraph. There is
no database and no server-side state; limit-order tags live in each user's browser
localStorage (device-local by design).

The **only secret** is a private RPC URL (`RPC` in `.env`) — Vite bakes env values
into the JS bundle, so a public build must never have it set. One build serves
every mode; the read transport resolves at runtime:

| mode | build | chain reads |
|---|---|---|
| personal / local | `.env` has `RPC` | that URL, baked (keep the build private) |
| server + reverse proxy | `RPC` unset | same-origin `/rpc` → your proxy holds the key server-side |
| plain static hosting | `RPC` unset | `/rpc` probe fails → falls back to the public RPC (keyless, slower) |

Wallet-facing chain metadata (`wallet_addEthereumChain`) always advertises the
**public** RPC — a private key-bearing URL never reaches users' wallets.

On top of all modes, **each user can bring their own RPC**: the footer `rpc:`
control accepts any http(s) JSON-RPC url, sanity-checks it with an `eth_chainId`
probe (must be 4663), stores it in that browser's localStorage and applies on
reload. A user-set endpoint takes priority over everything above; RESET returns
to the deployment default.

## Deploy

`npm run build` produces a static `dist/` — hash routing needs no rewrite rules,
so any static host works (CF Pages / Netlify / S3):

```bash
RPC="" npm run build   # RPC MUST be empty for any build you serve publicly
```

To keep a private RPC key server-side, serve `dist/` behind a reverse proxy that
terminates these same-origin paths. Nothing here is app-specific — any nginx /
caddy / Cloudflare Worker will do:

| path | proxies to | why |
|---|---|---|
| `/rpc` | your JSON-RPC upstream | key stays server-side; app auto-detects and uses it |
| `/kyber` | `https://aggregator-api.kyberswap.com` | build with `KYBERSWAP_AGGREGATOR_API_BASE_URL=/kyber` |
| `/kyber-setting` | `https://ks-setting.kyberswap.com` | token list |
| `/dexscreener` | `https://api.dexscreener.com` | UP33 TVL/volume stats |
| `/goldsky` | `https://api.goldsky.com` | UP33 v2 subgraph |
| `/graph-bsc-v2` | Graph gateway subgraph `8EjCaW…91AGrt`, with server-side bearer key | BSC Uniswap v2 stats |
| `/api` | your `indexer:manager` process on :8790 | per-chain Uniswap pool discovery |

Routing the data APIs through your own origin means the browser only ever talks
to your origin + the chain RPC + wallet relays, so users on restrictive networks
keep every feature. Recommended if you expose these publicly: rate-limit `/rpc`
per-IP plus a global ceiling, and 403 requests carrying a foreign browser
`Origin` so other sites can't burn your upstream quota through users' browsers.

`vite.config.ts` emulates every one of these proxies in dev and preview, so the
server mode is testable locally without deploying anything:

```bash
RPC="" npm run build && npm run preview   # /rpc upstream stays in the node process
```

Two constraints worth knowing before you touch the build config:
- Relative API bases need `new URL(x, location.origin)` — a bare
  `new URL('/kyber/…')` throws and silently kills all quotes.
- viem's `ccip` module is the bundle's only lazy chunk on an error path, and it
  is imported inside **every** eth_call error before the selector check. It is
  deliberately pinned into the eager bundle (`src/main.tsx`) so a redeploy can't
  404 it under an open tab and mask the real revert reason. Other stale lazy
  chunks (wallet SDKs, RainbowKit locales) are handled by a `vite:preloadError`
  guarded auto-reload. Serve old + new asset generations side by side across a
  deploy if you want open tabs to survive it.

## Security

Threat model researched against real dApp incidents (BadgerDAO injected-script
approval drain, Curve/CoW DNS hijacks, Ledger Connect Kit npm supply chain) and
the OWASP Web3 attack-vector list. Architecture principle: **static SPA + thin
stateless reverse proxy = minimal attack surface** — no accounts, no database,
no server-side keys; a heavier backend would add attack surface, not safety.

**Wallet-interaction safety (the money paths)**
- browser-wallet signing only; no key material anywhere in app, server, or storage
- exact-amount approvals; four gates on opaque kyber calldata (see Safety rails);
  writes chainId-pinned with deadlines; native-route mins from fresh on-chain price
- token picker rows always show the contract address (anti symbol-spoofing);
  contract directory lists full addresses linked to the explorer

**XSS / injected-drainer defenses**
- ships with CSP `script-src 'self'` in mind: no inline scripts, no eval, no
  third-party or CDN scripts — everything self-hosted and content-hashed. React
  escaping only (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), `noreferrer` on external links
- recommended headers when self-hosting: `X-Frame-Options DENY` +
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking), `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy` (all sensors off), `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
  same-origin-allow-popups` (wallet popups still work), `frame-src` limited to
  WalletConnect verify, HSTS at the edge
- `connect-src` stays `https:/wss:` by design: the footer bring-your-own-RPC
  feature and wallet relays need it; the script-src wall is the real defense

**Supply chain**
- dependencies exact-pinned (`.npmrc save-exact`) + lockfile — a compromised
  patch release can't slip in via re-install (Ledger-style attack)
- `npm audit` on every dependency change. Known open advisory: `ws` DoS via
  wagmi's WalletConnect chain — server-side-only issue, browsers use native
  WebSocket; the fix is a wagmi v2→v3 major migration, deferred deliberately
- zero analytics/trackers/third-party runtime scripts

**If you self-host publicly**, the frontend-integrity risk worth planning for is
DNS/CDN hijack: fetch your own live site the way users do and byte-compare
against your local build. A CSP with no inline scripts blocks injection at the
browser level even if HTML were tampered in transit.

## Known v1 limits

- Native-path swaps are single-hop (direct pools); kyber path covers multi-hop routing.
- UP33-native route with ETH input requires wrapping to WETH first (one click).
- veUP locking / voting / bribes are read-only concerns for later versions.
- Uniswap v2/v3 long-tail pools outside GeckoTerminal's top-200 lists show
  chain-derived TVL but no 24h volume (blank VOL/FEES/APR columns) — computing
  volume ourselves would mean indexing ~2.6M Swap events/day (measured);
  deliberately skipped.
- Uniswap v2 POSITIONS management (LP-token balances, remove-liquidity) is not
  wired yet — POOLS browse + add-liquidity only. v2 LPs are plain ERC-20s, so
  wallet-level tracking works meanwhile.
- Creating a NEW univ3 pool (`createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary`) is not
  wired up — mint into existing pools only.
- Uniswap v4 is live on Robinhood Chain but not integrated; the indexer's
  catalog model extends to v4 `Initialize` events if/when wanted.
